## Fan Control System

Our submission for the Design Project component of the **Microprocessors and Interfacing** course at BITS Pilani.
  
### Problem Statement
This system senses the speed at which the fan is rotating and adjusts the speed, based on
the user input. The user can select three different speeds of the fan. The current speed
should be sensed and the control mechanism should gradually increase the speed to the
desired speed.
